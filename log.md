The daily digest of my self-directed learnings.

## 2 April 2022

Today I set up this knowledge log repo as a place to organize and collect the
notes of my self-directed studies.

The README.md file contains an overview of my topics of interest, a self-
assessment of my skills, the (incomplete) first rough draft of my curriculum,
and a collection of links for future reference.

My daily routine shall include reviewing the README.md overview and following
the curriculum therein, recording my notes in this log.md file as I progress.
