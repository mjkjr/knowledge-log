The daily digest of my self-directed learnings.

## 5 April 2022

Today I spent some time going through
[Skynapse's Resources](https://github.com/Syknapse/resources) and adding to my
curriculum and reference links any that I felt would be personally most useful.

Next time I plan to do the same with the
[Rusty CS course material](https://github.com/AbdesamedBendjeddou/Rusty-CS).

Some resources that stuck out were [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/),
[Edabit](https://edabit.com/), and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/),
all of which I believe will not only be helpful in strengthening my coding
abilities, but will also be great to add to my profile links section. The
progress in these sorts of sites is tracked and works as nice little "badges of
honor". Additionally, this gives a couple of alternative options for work
progress if I have a day where I'm not particularly motivated to work through
the linear coursework (like today).

For now, I've signed up for Codewars and added it along with my other profile
links to the [About Me](./README.md#üß†-about-me) section of this knowledge log.

I also updated my Knowledge Log by adding a [Goals](./README.md#üèÜ-goals)
section that clearly lays out my goals for this project.

Finally, I added a spell-checking extension to Visual Studio code today.

## 2 April 2022

Today I set up this knowledge log repo as a place to organize and collect the
notes of my self-directed studies.

The README.md file contains an overview of my topics of interest, a self-
assessment of my skills, the (incomplete) first rough draft of my curriculum,
and a collection of links for future reference.

My daily routine shall include reviewing the README.md overview and following
the curriculum therein, recording my notes in this log.md file as I progress.
