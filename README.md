## üèÜ Goals

My initial goal with this project is to develop the necessary skills to make a
career change into the field of software development. More specifically: my
*ideal* position would be one in the video game industry. However, a career in
web development is also of interest to me.

Along the way I have an intermediate milestone which I'd also like to achieve
which is transitioning my existing brick-and-mortar business into an online-only
e-commerce shop.

After achieving these goals this project will continue to serve as an ongoing
log of my continued skill development. As such, this project exists as a sort of
"living resum√©" for potential employers and serves as a showcases of my current
skills and how I went about attaining them.
