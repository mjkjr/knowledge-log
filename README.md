## üèÜ Goals

My initial goal with this project is to develop the necessary skills to make a
career change into the field of software development. More specifically: my
*ideal* position would be one in the video game industry. However, a career in
web development is also of interest to me.

After achieving my initial goal this project will continue to serve as an
ongoing log of my continued skill development.

As such, this project exists as a sort of "living resum√©" for potential
employers and showcases my current skills and how I attained them.
